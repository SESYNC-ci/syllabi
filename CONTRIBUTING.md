# Overview

A syllabus for a SESYNC-cyberinfrastructure led short course provides logistical information, a schedule of lessons, and participation requirements. A new syllabus should be created, with up-to-date information, for every instance of a short course.

Once a syllabus is ready for public consumption, there's a good chance you should link to it from the [Summer Institute](https://www.sesync.org/for-you/cyberinfrastructure/institutes) or [Data Skills Workshop](https://www.sesync.org/for-you/cyberinfrastructure/data-skills-workshops) pages. The URL to link will follow this pattern:

    https://sesync-ci.github.io/syllabi/YYYY/MM/DD/title.html


# Create a Syllabus

Create or find syllabus templates in the `docs/_drafts/` folder. Copy a suitable template to the `docs/_posts/` folder following the naming convention of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Use the starting day of the event for the date.

For details on the YAML header fields, refer to the original [template](https://github.com/SESYNC-ci/syllabi/blob/71350afc40212e9f1d0a6178af6b86d8c93ec10b/docs/_drafts/template.md).
