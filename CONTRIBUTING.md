# Overview

A syllabus for a SESYNC-Cyberinfrastructure led course or workshop provides logistical information (including registration, if needed), the schedule of lessons, and participation requirements.
Each event has its own page

# Create a syllabus

Syllabus templates are in the `_drafts/` folder. Copy a suitable template to the `_posts/` folder following the naming convention of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, using the starting day of the event.

# Offline preview

No link exists to a new syllabus until it is created on SESYNC's main website, so it is not necessary to develop a new syllabus offline. In addition, the most accurate "preview" will result from letting GitHub's own Jekyll build environment create the page. To view the page for a syllabus, navigate to `https://sesync-ci.github.io/syllabi/YYYY/MM/DD/title.html`.

To truly preview a page offline, it is necessary to run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in a local clone of this repository as `jekyll serve --baseurl=''`.
