# data2doc

## Computational Summer Institute Mini-Project Description

The inspiration for the project name comes from a naming convention for command line conversion utilities.
The program `pdf2text`, for example, reads a pdf and converts any embedded text into a plain text document.
Your team's "data2doc" project should probably not go so far as to read in data and produce some kind of report in one command.

You teams's project should **aim to achieve the following four goals**:

- Collaborate on a GitHub (or similar) repository, where your project files will live.
- Incorporate a process (or at a minimum describe how you foresee) sharing project data. The PostgreSQL server is at your disposal.
