# CSI Mini-Project

Over the course of three team practices, your group should **aim to achieve the following goals** with assistance from your SESYNC coach:

- Collaborate on a GitHub repository, and keep it up to date.
- Incorporate or describe tables in a relational database you might use to share project data.
- Programatically read the data and use it in a simple analysis or vizualization.
- Present your README this morning, and your mini-results on Friday afternoon.

## Team Practice #1

1. Create a single GitHub repo for your team, and make everyone a collaborator.
1. Create a skeleton README.md with sections for each member to compose.
1. Everyone create a new RStudio project from the repo: then pull, edit, commit and push content.
