## The "data2doc" Mini-project
{:style="text-transform: none;"}

During four team practice sessions, your group should **aim to achieve the following goals** with assistance from your SESYNC coach:

- Collaborate on a GitHub repository, and keep it up to date.
- Incorporate or describe tables in a relational database you might use to share project data.
- Programatically read the data and use it in a simple analysis or vizualization.
- Present a README Tuesday morning, and mini-results on Friday afternoon.
