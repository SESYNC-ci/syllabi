## General Information

Version Control is instrumental to project stability (and user sanity!) in collaborative research that requires scientific coding. During this 1.5 to 2 hour session, we will begin to understand the fundamentals of the git version control system and how it integrates with the server based scripting environment hosted at SESYNC for your synthesis project.

## Pre-Call Instructions

**Requirements:**  
Participants must create an account on Bitbucket, required for project collaboration, and are strongly encouraged to install the software listed below, which will allow you to work on your version controlled project offline/locally.

### Bitbucket

If you do not already have a Bitbucket account, please create one at <https://bitbucket.org>.
Note that students and educators with an e-mail address from a academic institution are eligible for [unlimited public and private repositories](https://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/20/bitbucket-academic/).

Once you have created an account, please enter your username on the [Etherpad]{{ etherpad }} under the "Bitbucket Accounts" heading.

### Software

The training relies on SESYNC's web-based platforms, the only essential software is a modern internet browser.
Because the software we use is all open source, there are free versions that you can install locally.
Having the software installed locally allows you to work offline in nearly the same way you would on the SESYNC web-based platform.

Helping participants confirm their local installations are working will be the last part of our tutorial, so please install the following applications prior to the training. Always use the default installation options, and install the applications in order moving down the table. If you have previously installed any of this software, please upgrade to the latest version available for your operating system.

For **Windows users**, an installer for each item is available at the given download site.
**Mac users** may also find an installer at the download site, but are encouraged to use the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh){:target="_blank"} software manager via the Terminal application.
Most packages in the list below can be installed on a Mac with Homebrew by typing `brew install %package%` in the Terminal and pressing return, but packages with an * require `brew cask install %package%`.
**Ubuntu users** may install from the shell with `sudo apt-get install %package%`, and other Linux users are on their own.
