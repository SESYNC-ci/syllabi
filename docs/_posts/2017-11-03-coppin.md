# Getting to Data 

<!--[10:45 -- 12:00, total 75 min]-->

[Underwood et al. (2013)] use secondary data to estimate rates and locations of illegal ivory trade.

===

Identify a **strength** and a **weakness** of the following association between concept, variable, and data.

- **Concept**: Illegal wildlife trade in African nations
- **Variable**: Nationwide, annual seizures of illegally aquired ivory
- **Data**: [Any of the "sz.xx" columns in the ETIS data supplement].

[Underwood et al. (2013)]: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076539
[Any of the "sz.xx" columns in the ETIS data supplement]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=supplementary&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0076539.s007

<!-- 10 min -->

===

Think about a concept and variable relevant to the research question you've identified.

1. Think about a concept (possibly a node in the concept map) for your project, and describe an associated variable.
1. Explain how the variable relates to your research question.

<!-- 15 min -->

===

## Getting Secondary Data Online

1. Supplements to peer-reviewed publications
1. Data repositories (government, or university)
1. Directly from primary data provider 

<!-- 15 min -->

===

### Data Supplements

Peer-reviewed scientific journals are increasingly demanding that contributors include **raw data** as a supplement, or appendix, to the published report.

<!-- google scholar, "illegal ivory trade" -->

===

1. Google Scholar
1. Library electronic indexes
  - EBSCO
  - JSTOR
1. Subject area journal

===

### Data Repositories

A data repository is an organization dedicated to long term storage of digital data, usually accessible to the public over the internet.

===

Each repository is like a library for data, except that data is placed in only one library.

===

Data repositories have all kinds of data. Most commonly they host data associated with a scientific report, which the authors' aim to make publically accessible.

===

- [Figshare](https://figshare.com)
- [Dataverse Network](https://dataverse.org)
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu)

===

### Direct from primary data provider

1. Specific monitoring program's data portal
1. An entire organization's data catalog
1. E-mail a study's author

===

<!-- monitorring programs are very diverse: check out traffic, -->

Monitoring programs that use continuously recording sensors often have associated data portals.

- USGS Landsat <!-- earthexplorer.usgs.gov: dont' be login deterred -->
- NOAA Tides & Currents
- Maryland DNR <!-- search monitoring on DNR, check out eyes on the bay -->

===

- [Data.gov](https://data.gov)
- [NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/datasetsearch/datasetsearch.html)
- [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov)

<!-- for community information in uganda (elephant poaching area) www.ubos.org -->

===

### Quality

1. Must be able to identify methods for primary data collection
1. Good metadata is an indicator of good data

===

## Group Activity

Find and download one dataset for your project.

## Importing Different Data Formats

===

### Text files (.txt, .csv)

Use RStudio "Import (readr)" to generate R commands.

~~~r
library(readr)
sediment <- read_delim("/data/MusselWatch_EastCoast_Trace_Elements_Sediment.txt",
                       "\t", escape_double = FALSE,
                       trim_ws = TRUE)
View(sediment)
~~~
{:.input}

===

### Excel files (.xlsx)

Save As "CSV", then back to the previous step!

===

### Special formats (.shp, .hdf5)

Special data formats are used for spatial data.

~~~r
acs <- read_sf('/data/acs')

acs <- st_transform(acs, 4326)

m <- leaflet(acs) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addPolygons(
    color = "#444444", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5,
    opacity = 0.5, fillOpacity = 0.5,
    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", SHAPE_AREA)(SHAPE_AREA))

## Graphics in R

===

### Goals

- Create several different kinds of plots
- Learn to **layer** up visual representations of data
- Glimpse the vast collection of [ggplot2](){:.rpkg} options

===

~~~r
library(readr)
landings <- read_csv("/share/MF_MONTHLY_LANDINGS.RESULTS", 
                     skip = 5)
~~~
{:.input}

===

~~~r
names(landings)[7] <- "USD"
~~~
{:.input}

===

## Layered graphics

As a first example, create a simple scatter plot of one variable on the x-axis versus another on the y-axis.

~~~r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(landings,
       aes(x = Pounds, y = USD)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{:.input}

===

The `ggplot` command expects a data frame and an aesthetic mapping. The `aes` function creates the aesthetic, a mapping between variables in the data frame and visual elements in the plot. 

===

The `ggplot` function by itself does not display anything until we add a `geom_*` layer, in this example a `geom_point`. Layers are literally added, with `+`, to the object created by the `ggplot` function.

===

Color is also an "axis" that can be added to a plot, corresponding to another variable in the dataset.

~~~r
ggplot(landings,
       aes(x = Pounds, y = USD, color = Year)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{:.input}

===

A purpose of vizualization is to make patterns obvious; a big part is reducing clutter with summary values (e.g. total, mean or median).

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Year, y = Pounds)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = sum, geom = 'line')
~~~
{:.input}

===

Recognizing, of course, that summaries can accidentally hide patterns.

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Year, y = Pounds, color = State)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = sum, geom = 'line')
~~~
{:.input}

===

Histograms show the range of possibilities for all the data collected for a single variable.

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Pounds) +
  geom_histogram()
~~~
{:.input}

===

The "bin width" tunes a histogram for visual appeal if not something more significant.

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Pounds) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100000)
~~~
{:.input}

===

Distributions of data points for many different groups are vizualized with "boxplots".

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Month, y = USD,
           color = State)) +
  geom_boxplot()
~~~
{:.input}

===

Force your axes to make intuitive sense.

~~~r
landings$Month <- factor(landings$Month,
                         month.abb)
~~~
{:.input}

===

Label plots with the `labs()` function.

~~~r
ggplot(landings, 
       aes(x = Month, y = USD, color = State)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Value of Oyster Harvest: 1990-2016',
       x = "",
       y = "Monthly Total (USD)")
~~~
{:.input}

===

Combine multiple visual elements by adding more "geoms".

~~~r
ggplot(landings,
       aes(x = Month, y = USD,
       group = State, color = State)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = 'line') +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
               geom = 'errorbar') +
  labs(title = 'Value of Oyster Harvest: 1990-2016',
       x = "",
       y = "Monthly Mean +/- SE (USD)")
~~~
{:.input}


===

Sometimes the best way to clarify data is to plot it separately.

~~~r
ggplot(landings,
       aes(x = Month, y = USD,
           group = State)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = 'line') +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
               geom = 'errorbar') +
  facet_wrap(~ State) +
  labs(title = 'Value of Oyster Harvest: 1990-2016',
       x = "",
       y = "Monthly Mean +/- SE (USD)")
~~~
{:.input}
